## What is Acid House Music?
 
Acid house is a subgenre of house music that emerged in the late 1980s, influenced by the Chicago house scene and the use of the TB-303 bass synthesizer. The TB-303 was originally intended as a bass accompaniment for guitarists, but it was soon discovered that by tweaking its knobs, it could produce distinctive squelchy and resonant sounds that became characteristic of acid house. The term "acid" refers to both the sound of the TB-303 and the psychedelic effects of LSD, which was popular among some ravers at the time.
 
Acid house music typically features a four-on-the-floor drum beat, a repetitive bass line with slides and accents, and various synth pads, stabs, and effects. The tempo ranges from 120 to 150 BPM, and the mood can vary from dark and hypnotic to upbeat and euphoric. Some of the pioneers of acid house include Phuture, DJ Pierre, Armando, Adonis, Mr. Fingers, and 808 State.

ABL2 is a plugin that can be used with any DAW that supports VST or AU formats. It has a simple and intuitive interface that resembles the original TB-303, with knobs for tuning, cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope modulation, decay time, accent amount, volume, and distortion. It also has a pattern editor that allows you to program up to 128 patterns with up to 64 steps each. You can also import patterns from Rebirth RB-338 or Freebee, or use the audio detection feature to create patterns from audio files.
 
To create acid house music with ABL2, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new project in your DAW and load ABL2 as an instrument track.
2. Select a preset from the menu or create your own sound by adjusting the knobs. You can also use the randomize function to generate new sounds.
3. Program a pattern using the pattern editor or select one from the menu. You can use the transpose and slide buttons to create variations and glides. You can also use the accent button to emphasize certain notes.
4. Adjust the tempo and sync mode according to your preference. You can sync ABL2 to your DAW's tempo or use an internal tempo. You can also choose between 16th notes or rests as time modes.
5. Add some effects such as reverb, delay, chorus, or flanger to enhance your sound. You can also use external plugins or hardware effects if you wish.
6. Record your performance by playing notes on your MIDI keyboard or using your mouse. You can also automate the knobs using MIDI CC messages or your DAW's automation features.
7. Mix and master your track using EQ, compression, limiting, and other tools.
